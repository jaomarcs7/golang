# Joao mendonca 

Repository created to learn the fundamentals of the Golang language, I will be using the book [Introduction to GOlang] as a basis for Studies (Links).

I will be carrying out several introductory exercises to familiarize myself with the language and after that I will carry out a practical challenge to further exercise logical reasoning.

**This repository is being started on: 2023-10-13.**
